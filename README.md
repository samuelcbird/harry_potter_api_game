# Harry Potter API Game 

This is a simple game designed to be easy and addictive to play. The objective of the game is to select the correct house (Griffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin) that the currently displayed character is part of. For each correct answer that is given another randomly selected character will appear. 

If you give an incorrect answer, you have to start again. 

## Why did I build this game? 

As an aspiring React frontend Web Developer I wanted to gain experience creating an app which used data from an external API. 

When I found the [Harry Potter API](https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/), I realised this could come in the form of a game. 

## Stack

- React
- Sass
- Axios

## Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Build Status

Runs as expected.

## What's next?

When I get more time to work on this project I would like to:

- Improve the accessibility so the game is playable using just the keyboard.
- Add the functionality for users to keep track of their scores. This could be in the form of local browser storage or alternatively, if using an external database I could introduce a leaderboard system too.
